# Something awesome project

This is my something awesome project for Comp6841. My aim was to learn frontend development and expand my knowledge of backend development as well. 

Of course, since this is a security course, I aim to identify common security issues by describing what they are, how they work and how I have addressed them.

My main notes/reflections will be on Notion here:
